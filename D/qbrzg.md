# Writeup

[ZCASH](https://z.cash/the-basics/)is a privacy preserving crypto currency. It is quite similar to bitcoin in the aspect of having a publicly accessible transaction ledger. Its privacy component is the differentiation factor.

[ZCASH](https://z.cash/the-basics/) provides privacy and anonymity in cryto transactions by the following ways 
1. Zcash gives you the option of confidential transactions and financial privacy through **shielded addresses**.  This is made possible by [ZK(Zero Knowledge Proofs)](https://z.cash/technology/zksnarks/) -  Zero-knowledge proofs allow transactions to be verified without revealing the sender, receiver or transaction amount.

2. Zcash  also has selective [disclosure features](https://z.cash/technology/) that allow the sharing of some details for the prupose of compliance and audit 

These features makes zcash a preferred privacy preserving cryptocurrency, that can be used in regulated environments.
