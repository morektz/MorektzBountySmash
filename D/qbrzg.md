# Introduction

[ZCASH](https://z.cash/the-basics/) is a privacy preserving crypto currency. It is quite similar to bitcoin in the aspect of having a publicly accessible transaction ledger. Its privacy component is the differentiation factor.

[ZCASH](https://z.cash/the-basics/) provides privacy and anonymity in cryto transactions by the following ways 
1. Zcash gives you the option of confidential transactions and financial privacy through **shielded addresses**.  This is made possible by [ZK(Zero Knowledge Proofs)](https://z.cash/technology/zksnarks/) -  Zero-knowledge proofs allow transactions to be verified without revealing the sender, receiver or transaction amount.

2. Zcash  also has selective [disclosure features](https://z.cash/technology/) that allow the sharing of some details for the prupose of compliance and audit.

The [ZCASH Foundation](https://www.zfnd.org/), is a public charitable organization that builds financial privacy infrastructure for the pubic good, primariy serving the users of the ZCASH protocol and blockchain. They are also actively invovled in supporting other applications of [zero-knowledge](https://zkp.science/) cryptography as well as other approaches to private crypto currency.

The Zcash Foundation funds Zcash development, research, and other ecosystem projects through a platform called [ZF Grants](https://www.zfnd.org/grants/).

## What 

[Zcash Grants](https://grants.zfnd.org/) provides funding for the Zcash ecosystem projects.
## Why 

[Zcash Grants](https://grants.zfnd.org/) is supported by the [ZCASH Foundation](https://www.zfnd.org/), whose goal is to advance the adoption of privacy centric financial infrastructure by adopting the [ZCASH](https://z.cash/the-basics/) protocol. As stated on the foundation's [GUIDE.](https://grants.zfnd.org/guide)

> The Zcash Foundation awards grant funding to Zcash ecosystem projects that advance our mission as a public charity. In short, that mission is to build and support privacy tools for everyone and anyone, both serving and guided by the Zcash Community.

## Consideration Process / Selection Process 

Every grant application should contain the fundamental principle of enhancing financial privacy by usage of the Zcash protocol. As described in their [GUIDE.](https://grants.zfnd.org/guide)

> Privacy is the Foundation's focus and priority, so an ideal grant project is one that promotes, encourages, facilitates, or incorporates shielded addresses and z2z transactions. An ideal grant proposal defines who will benefit from the project, as well as how and why. Lastly, an ideal grant proposal is clear, pragmatic, detailed, and justified by solid evidence or reasoning.

In addition to advancing the Zcash ecosystem. The following are guiding principle which every application should follow:

1. Clear = Plainly stated and easy to understand.
2. Pragmatic = Has realistic goals and expectations.
3. Deatailed = Includes a concrete plan of action
4. Justified = Aligned with the foundations [mission.](https://www.zfnd.org/about/#mission)
