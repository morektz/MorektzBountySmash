# Introduction

[ZCASH](https://z.cash/the-basics/)is a privacy preserving crypto currency. It is quite similar to bitcoin in the aspect of having a publicly accessible transaction ledger. Its privacy component is the differentiation factor.

[ZCASH](https://z.cash/the-basics/) provides privacy and anonymity in cryto transactions by the following ways 
1. Zcash gives you the option of confidential transactions and financial privacy through **shielded addresses**.  This is made possible by [ZK(Zero Knowledge Proofs)](https://z.cash/technology/zksnarks/) -  Zero-knowledge proofs allow transactions to be verified without revealing the sender, receiver or transaction amount.

2. Zcash  also has selective [disclosure features](https://z.cash/technology/) that allow the sharing of some details for the prupose of compliance and audit 

These features makes zcash a preferred privacy preserving cryptocurrency, that can be used in regulated environments. It has gained wide spread adoption, by major wallets and crypto-exchanges

The [ZCASh Foundation](https://www.zfnd.org/), is a public charitable organization that builds financial privacy infrastructure for the pubic good, primariy serving the users of the ZCASH protocol and blockchain. They are also actively invovled in supporting other applications of [zero-knowledge](https://zkp.science/) cryptography as well as other approaches to private crypto currency.

The Zcash Foundation funds Zcash development, research, and other ecosystem projects through a platform called [ZF Grants](https://www.zfnd.org/grants/).

## What 

[Zcash Grants](https://grants.zfnd.org/) provides funding for the Zcash ecosystem projcts.
## Why 

[Zcash Grants](https://grants.zfnd.org/) is supported by the [ZCASh Foundation](https://www.zfnd.org/), whose goal is to advance the adoption of privacy centric financial infrastructure by adopting the [ZCASH](https://z.cash/the-basics/) protocol. As stated on the foundation's [GUIDE.](https://grants.zfnd.org/guide)

> The Zcash Foundation awards grant funding to Zcash ecosystem projects that advance our mission as a public charity. In short, that mission is to build and support privacy tools for everyone and anyone, both serving and guided by the Zcash Community.

> We are seeking grant projects that will help people understand, access, or use Zcash and its powerful privacy protections. You should aim to achieve one of the following:

- Improve the Zcash protocol or auxiliary software (inclusive of research).
- Create resources for people who already save and spend ZEC.
- Expand the Zcash community and/or increase Zcash adoption.
